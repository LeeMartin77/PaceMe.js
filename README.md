# PaceMe.js - Run planning application, in javascript.

The core idea is to be a nicely deployable run/training planning application, to help keep track of the runs being done.

## Prerequisites

- Node (ideally, use a version manager like `fnm` or `nvm`)

## Getting Started

0. Run `npm install` in `.infrastructure`, `api` and `webapp`
1. Run `npm run cdk:deploy:devout` to deploy scaffolding resources and update env files
2. Run `npm start` in the `webapp` and `api` directories **OR** Run `npm start` in the root directory
3. Happy hacking!
